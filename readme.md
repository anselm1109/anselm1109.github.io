# Simply Pray

Simply Pray is a small web app created to help me in my practice of Centering Prayer. 

## How it works.
Simply click or tap on the right side of the screen or on the right arrow in the nav bar to be guided through 5 screens

1. An opening prayer
2. A daily reading from the Psalms
3. A Prayer of intent to begin your time of silent / Centering prayer
4. A timer that ends with a quiet piano music
5. A closing prayer. 

## Other features
1. You can change which prayers display on each of those pages as well as the amount of time for silence.
2. There is a ruidimentary prayer book included. This will allow you to browse all the prayers available.
3. On mobile the app can be added to your phone's homescreen and it will function very much like a native app. 

## Things to know. 
* This app runs entirely in your browser. Nothing is sent / saved / synced to the cloud
* The prayer time is a video, this prevents screens from going to sleep. On mobile devices you also need to not lock your screen as this will pause the timer.
